Project Description  

To implement the A* using both heuristics and compare their efficiency in terms of depth of the solution and search costs.  
To test your program and analyze the efficiency, you can use the inputs that I provided to test your program. 
Please collect data on the different solution lengths that you have tested, with their corresponding search cost (# of nodes generate). 
A good testing program should test a range of possible cases (2 <= d <= 20). Note that the average solution cost for a 
randomly generated 8-puzzle instance is about 22 steps.
